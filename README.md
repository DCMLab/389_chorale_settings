# A digital edition of the 389 Chorale Settings (Choralgesänge) by J.S. Bach


This repository has been made possible by Gertim Alberda, 
who ‘manually’ digitalized all the 389 Bach 4-voice chorales, 
as published by the [Breitkopf edition 'nr. 3765'](https://imslp.org/wiki/Special:ReverseLookup/348824). 
For this he meticulously transcribed all the notes and lyrics of that edition, by using the music notation editor MuseScore (MS). 
He checked it against both BGA and NBA (Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe and Neue Bach-Ausgabe), 
if there was any reasonable doubt for it, and even found and improved a couple of mistakes that way (<10).
Solely for performance reasons, he also applied many hidden (grey) extras in MS to make the scores and its phrasing 
sound as realistic as possible; hidden fermatas, tempo changes, breath pauses, phrasing, note-cutbacks, etc. 
This was all done to 'humanize' the playback and make it sound like a real choir performance (without words), 
and given the technical limitations at that time (2016-2018). 
Also see the [Info](https://gertim-alberda.com/chorales/info.html) tab on his website.

The full corpus resides on Gertim Alberda’s [dedicated website](https://gertim-alberda.com/chorales). 
The scores there have synchronized play back (synthesized and human performances) available 
and can be downloaded in various formats (mscz/xml/midi/mp3/pdf). 
[Here is an example](https://gertim-alberda.com/chorales/BachChorales/B288.html) of his playback page. 
His intention is to have only human performances available (YT videos and/or mp3’s) for all the scores, 
but that is still an ongoing process 
(see the [changelog](https://gertim-alberda.com/chorales/changelog_bach_chorales.html) on his website).
